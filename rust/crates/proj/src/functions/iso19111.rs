//!The PJ* objects returned by proj_create_from_wkt(),
//! proj_create_from_database() and other functions in that section will have
//! generally minimal interaction with the functions declared in the previous
//! sections (calling those functions on those objects will either return an
//! error or default/nonsensical values). The exception is for ISO19111 objects
//! of type CoordinateOperation that can be exported as a valid PROJ pipeline.
//! In this case, objects will work for example with proj_trans_generic().
//! Conversely, objects returned by proj_create() and proj_create_argv(), which
//! are not of type CRS (can be tested with proj_is_crs()), will return an error
//! when used with functions of this section.
